Review the CLAUDE.md file and check for:

## User CLAUDE.md (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] Has context marker (🍀 emoji)
- [ ] 20-40 lines (not bloated)
- [ ] No project-specific content
- [ ] Has push-back permissions
- [ ] Has alignment check instruction

## Project CLAUDE.md
- [ ] 30-60 lines
- [ ] Has project description
- [ ] Has real commands (not generic)
- [ ] Has domain-specific quirks/gotchas
- [ ] No personal preferences (those belong in user file)

## Anti-patterns to flag
- Vague rules ("write clean code")
- Too many rules (dilutes attention)
- Duplicated content between user/project

Provide specific, actionable improvements.
