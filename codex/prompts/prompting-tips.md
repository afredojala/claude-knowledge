Before proceeding, apply these prompting principles:

1. **Check alignment**: "Tell me your plan in 3-4 bullets before implementing"
2. **Cast wide**: "What alternatives haven't we considered?"
3. **Small steps**: Break complex work into verified steps
4. **Know when to reset**: At iteration 3-4 with no improvement, delete and restart

Now proceed with the user's request, applying these principles.
